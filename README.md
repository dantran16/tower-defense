# Beltch TD
BeltchTD is a unique and engaging tower defense game where players strategically place customers to defend against waves of enemy food. This project was inspired by early 2000s browser games like BloonsTD and Diner Dash. Set in a 2D pixel food world, the game challenges players to think like a restaurant host, seating guests so that they eat as much as possible. If the food reaches the trash bin, you lose profits and risk bankruptcy.
